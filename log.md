# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Minimal Javascript today.

**Thoughts:** I had more hardware work at the office and no time at home for code. I did five challenges to keep going and I continued reading The Pragmatic Programmer.

**Link to work:** none

### Day 17: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript. If, Else if, Case and Switch

**Thoughts**: Took me a while to get started but blew it up once I did. I am only quitting after 25 chalenges to go to a meeting. It's always better when you start. The stuff is getting more difficult and I needed to look a couple up to get started or run down my error. Tomorrow is the challenging day. The goal is a single challenge.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
